# The Cpu Center

The CPU Center is a mock storefront web app, serving as a final project that showcases the integration of various technologies to simulate a dynamic and immersive computer hardware shopping experience. This project utilizes Angular 17, reinforced with an Ionic framework layer for mobile compatibility, to craft a visually engaging and seamlessly navigable front end.

Backing this  interface is a Django server, designed to handle fetch requests for user authentication and data management. 

For data storage, a Microsoft SQL Server database was used, designed to accommodate the array of product listings, user profiles, and transaction records you would come across in an actual marketplace. 

The CPU Center represents a culmination of knowledge learned through my Python programming course, as well as my own personal exploration of web frameworks; and it serves as a display of the culmination of knowledge, creativity, and technical prowess acquired throughout my time in university.
